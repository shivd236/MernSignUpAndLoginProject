# MernSignUpAndLoginProject
This project, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), allows users to sign up and log in, with a token generated at login. The token can be used to verify identity and access a protected dashboard. The project uses Mongoose for database handling, with React managing the user interface.
